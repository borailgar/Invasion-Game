Thanks for downloading the Old Family House Interior asset! 
You can find all you will need within the Prefabs folder. There are several directories for different items.
An example scene can be found in the scenes folder.

In order to start creating a new house, simply drag in the Base(House1/Prefabs/Base/Base.prefab) prefab and the Control Prefab(House1/Prefabs/Base/1HouseControl.prefab). You can then add furniture from this and any other asset packs you want, to customize the house to your needs.

Several windows and doors can be operated using the house control script(Found on the 1HouseControlAsset) using the sliders there. You can tick any of the checkboxes to ask the script to locate the correct objects in case it doesn't  automatically.

Thanks for using this asset. Feel free to request any extra pieces of furniture or solutions to problems within the pack. I will aim to answer within a day if possible.
