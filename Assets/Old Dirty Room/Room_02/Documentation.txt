I recommend importing the package in a new, empty project.
Make sure your Rendering Path is set to Deffered and the Color Space is set to Linear (You can change these setting by going to Edit > Project Settings > Player)
Also, make sure you go to Edit > Project Settings > Quality and disable the Anti-Aliasing, otherwise the HDR won't work.

In order to achieve the same visual quality I presented, make sure you import the "Effects" pack (Assets > Import Package > Effects) as well as the Cinematic Image Effects from the AssetStore.

After you've imported those packages, select your camera and add:
Anti-Aliasing
Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
Screen Space Reflection
Bloom
Tonemapping Color Grading
Vignette and Chromatic Aberration
Fisheye
